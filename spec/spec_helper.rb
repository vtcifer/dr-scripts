# Testing Conventions
#
# File organization:
#   - One spec file per script, named to match: <script-name>_spec.rb
#     (e.g. dependency_spec.rb for dependency.lic, pick_spec.rb for pick.lic)
#
# Principles:
#   - DAMP (Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases): favor readable, self-documenting
#     test names and setup over extreme DRYness. Each test should be understandable
#     in isolation without chasing helper definitions.
#   - SOLID: extract shared behavior into shared_examples when the same assertions
#     apply across multiple contexts. Use let/before for setup, not deep inheritance.
#     Keep each test focused on a single responsibility.
#
# Lich runtime isolation:
#   - Scripts (.lic files) cannot be required directly -- they depend on the full
#     Lich runtime. Extract constants and methods via eval of specific line ranges
#     (see dependency_spec.rb for the pattern).
#   - Mock only what you need: UserVars, Settings, Script.current, _respond, etc.
#   - Use the test harness (test/test_harness.rb) for specs that need game objects.

require 'ostruct'

# Load the test harness which provides mock game objects:
# Flags, DRStats, DRSkill, DRRoom, Room, Map, GameObj, etc.
load File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'test', 'test_harness.rb')

include Harness

# Load SigilHarvest class definition without executing the top-level code
# (before_dying block and SigilHarvest.new) at the bottom of the .lic file.
#
# Strategy: read the file, extract lines from the `class SigilHarvest` opening
# through the matching `end` at column 0, then eval only that slice.
